## Understanding Deep Q-Networks

DQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle complex state spaces like game screens. The neural network takes raw pixels as input and outputs estimated future rewards (Q-values) for each possible action. This allows the agent to make decisions that maximize long-term reward.

The core algorithm:

```
Initialize replay memory with capacity N
Initialize Q-network with random weights
For each episode:
    Reset game state
    While game is active:
        With probability ε select random action
        Otherwise select action with highest Q-value
        Execute action and observe reward and new state
        Store experience tuple (state, action, reward, next_state) in replay memory
        Sample random batch from replay memory
        Update Q-network weights using gradient descent
        Update state
```

## Implementation Details

### Preprocessing Pipeline
To simplify learning, game screens undergo preprocessing:

1. Grayscale conversion
2. Resize to 80×80 pixels
3. Stack 4 consecutive frames as input (80×80×4)

### Neural Network Architecture

The agent uses a convolutional neural network:

- Input layer: 80×80×4 (four stacked frames)
- Convolutional layer 1: 32 filters (8×8), stride 4, ReLU activation
- Max pooling layer: 2×2 pool size
- Convolutional layer 2: 64 filters (4×4), stride 2, ReLU activation
- Max pooling layer: 2×2 pool size
- Convolutional layer 3: 64 filters (3×3), stride 1, ReLU activation
- Max pooling layer: 2×2 pool size
- Fully connected layer: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
- Output layer: 2 units (flap/don't flap)

### Training Configuration

- Replay memory size: 500,000 experiences
- Minibatch size: 32
- Discount factor (γ): 0.99
- Initial exploration rate (ε): 0.1
- Final exploration rate: 0.0001
- Exploration annealing frames: 3,000,000
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 1e-6
- Target network update frequency: Every 10,000 steps

## Experimental Results

After approximately 1,500,000 frames of training, the agent consistently achieves scores of 300+ points, showing significant improvement over random play (average score: 12). The agent develops strategies to maintain optimal height and time its flaps precisely when approaching pipes.

## Technical Considerations

The initial training phase uses exploration to build experience. The agent acts randomly for 10,000 frames before training begins. I chose a starting exploration rate (ε) of 0.1 rather than 1.0 to prevent excessive flapping that would keep the bird at the top of the screen, limiting exploration of the state space.

## Troubleshooting

### Checkpoint Errors
If you encounter checkpoint errors, check that the path in `saved_networks/checkpoint` points to an existing model file.

### Performance Issues
For GPU memory management:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
```
